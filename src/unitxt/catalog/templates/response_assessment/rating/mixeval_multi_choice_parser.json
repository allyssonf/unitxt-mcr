Your task is to extract and judge the option chosen by the model based on its response, without seeing the context of the question. The option should be one of the provided option letters in the question. You should first briefly give your reasoning process, and then give a rate \"[[10]]\" if the answer is right, and \"[[0]]\" if the answer is wrong. Your judgement score should strictly follow this format: \"[[rate]]\", e.g. \"My verdict is: [[rate]]\". \n\n",
